#Eternal Bliss: The Legend Lives On

This is a strictly static port of the original 2012 site, originally hosted on Heroku (as it was utilizing a small DB for vocabulary). The vocab has been moved to static JSON on AWS. Nothing else has been changed – for better or worse =]

The JS codebase is pretty damn ugly, but hey, this was early 2012... Might be a fun project to rebuild at some point.
